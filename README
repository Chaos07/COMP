There are 3 directories: 'Q2-1', 'Q2-2' and 'tests'
Each directory contains the solution to a question of the first COMP
assignment. Directory names should be self-explanatory.

Each directory contains a Makefile. Note that ANTLR_JAR should be set to point
to the correct antlr jar file. This can be done by giving make the argument
ANTLR_JAR=value, where value is the path to the antlr archive as in `make
ANTLR_JAR=/path/to/antlr.jar'

In summary, to build the lexer and parser, just issue 'make' with the correct
path to antlr in the directories provided to that effect.
To further test the lexer and parser, issue 'make run < testfile' from within
the correct directories, where testfile is a test file you provide. Note that 2
test files are provided within this tarball in the 'tests' directory.
