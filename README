Instructions:
    Don't freak out!
    There are two main directories here: Q2.1 and Q2.2.
    Each directory name represent a question in the homework "TP1" and therefore
    contains a working solution to that specific question.
    Additionally, each directory also contains a makefile, the variable
    ANTLR_JAR in each makefile should be modified to point to the full path of
    the antlr jar file.

    to build the parsers and lexers just cd to Q2.1 or Q2.2 and issue the
    command make.
    to run the program that tests the parser and the lexer generated issue the
    command : make run < testfile.

    you can find two test files in the tests directory.
